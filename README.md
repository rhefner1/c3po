# C-3PO Bot

Hello - I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations!  I was created with the mission of assisting the Beasts of the East with
anything and everything that I can. I can respond to events or perform various actions.

If you address me (as `c3po` or `C-3PO`), then I will respond to the following commands:

| Command |     Response    |
|---------|-----------------|
| hello   | I'll greet you. |

Also, I'm always listening. I'll respond to specific words that I hear even if I'm not addressed:

| Command | Response |
|---------|----------|
|         |          |

I can currently connect to chat rooms hosted on GroupMe, though I have the ability to expand to more places further down the road.

I was lovingly created by [Ryan Hefner](http://r.hefner1.com)
